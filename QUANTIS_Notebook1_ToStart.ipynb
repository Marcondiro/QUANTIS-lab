    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We sometimes refer to this as _collapsing_ the state of the qubit. It is a potent effect, and so one that must be used wisely. For example, were we to constantly measure each of our qubits to keep track of their value at each point in a computation, they would always simply be in a well-defined state of either $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$. As such, they would be no different from classical bits and our computation could be easily replaced by a classical computation. To achieve truly quantum computation we must allow the qubits to explore more complex states. Measurements are therefore only used when we need to extract an output. This means that we often place all the measurements at the end of our quantum circuit. \n",

    "Given how we defined the Bloch sphere in the earlier chapters, it may not be clear how Qiskit even calculates the Bloch vectors with entangled qubits like this. In the single-qubit case, the position of the Bloch vector along an axis nicely corresponds to the expectation value of measuring in that basis. If we take this as _the_ rule of plotting Bloch vectors, we arrive at this conclusion above. This shows us there is _no_ single-qubit measurement basis for which a specific measurement is guaranteed. This contrasts with our single qubit states, in which we could always pick a single-qubit basis. Looking at the individual qubits in this way, we miss the important effect of correlation between the qubits. We cannot distinguish between different entangled states. For example, the two states:\n",

One such visualization is the _Q-sphere,_ here each amplitude is represented by a blob on the surface of a sphere. The size of the blob is proportional to the magnitude of the amplitude, and the colour is proportional to the phase of the amplitude. The amplitudes for $|00\\rangle$ and $|11\\rangle$ are equal, and all other amplitudes are 0:"
